We will see this more when covering variables and types. An expression would be something like \"3 < 5\".  In code, what this \"expresses\" is \"3 is less than 5\".\n","\n","**Statement**:\n","\n","A statement is the smallest standalone element of a language that \"says something\". Common examples you will see include If-Then statments, as well as For and While loops.\n","\n","*Note: Many words that have a definition in english that you are used to may have a completely different meaning in computer programming.

It is important to understand code when you come back to it or when other developers need to use it. One way we can achieve this is through comments.

When reading code for the first time, your best bet is to read it line by line, top to bottom to see what actions will be taken, and what references are made.  It's important to note that the code when executed by the computer may not perform actions in the exact sequence you see:  the program may make references to previous sections of code (like with *functions*), it may have a number of options presented and only take one particular path depending on what values it has been given (like with *if statements*), or it may take single lines of code and repeat them many times (like with *loops*).

Here are three of the most common types we'll be seeing:\n","\n","1. **Numeric**.  There are two main types of numeric values, **integer (int)** and **float**.  An integer is a whole number that is either positive or negative (e.g.: 5, 10, -2, 3245). A float is a number with decimals (e.g. 12.217, -3.2, 0.111). \n","2. **String**. A string is a sequence of characters. They have no inherent value other than just literally the characters in the order they appear.  They are denoted by putting quotations marks around symbols; examples include \"a\", \"xyzwp\", \"Hello World!\", and even numbers when placed in the quotations like \"1\".  (To be clear, 12 is an integer, \"12\" is a string.)\n","3. **Boolean**. Booleans are ```True``` or ```False``` values.\n","\n","There are other types we will be seeing soon, such as lists, dictionaries, and dataframes.\n","\n","**Use**\n","\n","Numeric types are used for computation and storing numerical data (which we'll be seeing a lot of).
